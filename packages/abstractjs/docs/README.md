# abstractjs
This repository holds the type declarations and interfaces for our smart contracts in CosmWasm.
Autogenerated contracts lie in [generated](generated) and those that are "fixed" are placed in [src/contracts](src/contracts).

## Scripts
- `pnpm build`: Generate the types
- `pnpm fix`: Temporary fixes for the autogenerated contracts (TODO)
- `pnpm format`: Run prettier
- `pnpm lint`: Run linter
- `pnpm lint:fix`: Attempt linter fixes

## TODO
We may want to generate docs for this repository and can do that using `typedoc`. However, none of our autogenerated code methods is currently commented.
